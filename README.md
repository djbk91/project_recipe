TOP Project: Build a Recipe

This is the first project in TOP, I will use the README file to log the steps at which I got stuck or had to look an answer up to help review after the lesson.

1. Looked up how to make repo in github and clone - did remember ssh not url
2. Couldn't find the Home file - visible on desktop but found at root, not desktop
3. Stopped on README step, adding text to a document via CLI is unknown and causes pause. Answer was unrelated, as README was created in clone and just needed to be edited via VS code
4.
